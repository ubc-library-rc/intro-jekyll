<p>This workshop is meant to introduce you to the concept of static websites and to show you how to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to quickly and easily publish a static site using only your browser. We will also provide some background information on the default Jekyll installation setup and the structure of a typical Jekyll site. Finally we’ll look at customizing your Jekyll site.</p>
