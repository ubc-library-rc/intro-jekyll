<h3 id="goal-of-this-workshop">Goal of this workshop</h3>

<p>Our goal is to understand how to get a local Jekyll site up and running, and how to host it with GitHub Pages. You will not be an expert by the end of the class. You may not feel totally comfortable using Jekyll – this is okay. We want to make a start but, as with any skill, using Jekyll and GitHub Pages takes practice.</p>

<p>This is your session. If you have a question or feel we are going too fast, please let the instructor know. We can decide as a group what to cover.</p>
