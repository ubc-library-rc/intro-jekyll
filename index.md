# Intro to Jekyll

This workshop is meant to give you the skills to create and publish a static website using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We'll explore the default Jekyll installation setup and walk through the steps to publish a basic web site. We'll cover the basic building blocks of Jekyll sites and discuss best practices for organizing your content. Finally we'll look at customizing your Jekyll site.

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub.com account](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}. We'll use GitHub Pages to host our static site.
- Some familiarity with working in a command line / Unix shell interface. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, please first start with this workshop: [Intro to the Unix Shell](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-shell/){:target="_blank"}.
- Some familiarity with Git and GitHub. We'll use Git and GitHub workflows to publish our site. If you'd like to learn more about Git and GitHub before going any further, please see this workshop: [Intro to Git and GitHub](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-git/){:target="_blank"}.
- Some experience working with code syntax and code editors is helpful.

Unless you set your Github repository to private, the information that you publish to your GitHub.com account will be publicly visible. As of 2019, Github allows unlimited private repositories for free accounts.
