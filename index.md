# Introduction to Jekyll and GitHub Pages

_[View workshop slides here](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-jekyll/slides/)_

This workshop is meant to introduce you to the concept of static websites and to show you how to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to quickly and easily publish a static site using only your browser. We will also provide some background information on the default Jekyll installation setup and the structure of a typical Jekyll site. Finally we'll look at customizing your Jekyll site.

## Prerequisites

- A [GitHub.com account](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}. We'll use GitHub Pages to host our static site.
- Some familiarity with Git and GitHub. We'll use Git and GitHub workflows to publish our site. If you'd like to learn more about Git and GitHub before going any further, please see this workshop: [Introduction to Git and GitHub](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-git/){:target="_blank"}.

Unless you set your Github repository to private, the information that you publish to your GitHub.com account will be publicly visible. As of 2019, Github allows unlimited private repositories for free accounts.
